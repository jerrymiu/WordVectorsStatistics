**********************************************************************
This wordvec.py script will read in a sample of English, French, or Korean training text and then uses the skip-gram model to train the word vectors. Each pair of words has a probability of appearing together determined by the number of times these pairs of words occur in the training text. For instance, in the training samples, ('United', 'States') will appear more often than ('United', 'Cows'), therefore after training, if the input word is 'United' then 'States' would be outputted with a higher probability compared to 'Cows'. Output will be generated as output.txt in the same directory as this python script. As well, a graph plotting the relative semantic closeness between words is created as tsne.png

**********************************************************************
This wordvec.py script will read in a sample of English, French, or Korean training text and then uses the skip-gram model to train the word vectors. Each pair of words has a probability of appearing together determined by the number of times these pairs of words occur in the training text. For instance, in the training samples, ('United', 'States') will appear more often than ('United', 'Cows'), therefore after training, if the input word is 'United' then 'States' would be outputted with a higher probability compared to 'Cows'. Output will be generated as output.txt in the same directory as this python script. As well, a graph plotting the relative semantic closeness between words is created as tsne.png
